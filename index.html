	    About Me
	  </h1>
	  <h3>
	    My name is Sam Kuhbander and I am currently a 2nd-year software engineering student at Miami University. I was born in Lansing, Michigan and I grew up in Dayton, Ohio.  I have always enjoyed working through and solving difficult problems.  Software engineering has allowed me to apply my problem solving skills to more complex problems by using the fundamentals of computer science. Outside of my course work, I spend time learning about emerging computer science technologies.  Now, I am hoping to contribute to exciting and fast moving tech world.
	  </h3>
	  <h3>
	  	<br>
	  	 I believe that computers can provide exciting and challenging careers. While I am focusing on software development, some other computer science topics that I am also very interested in are complexity, machine learning, networking and human-computer interaction.
